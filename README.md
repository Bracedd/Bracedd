# Hey, I’m Divpreet! 👋

I’m a Year 10 student who loves building random stuff with code. I make games, web apps, iOS tools, and some pretty cool projects. Some of my favorites are:

*   **Desky app:** An always-on desk helper for all your important info.
*   **ScurvyScript:** A funny, high-seas themed programming language I’m making. 🏴‍☠️
*   **QuickBytes:** A dashboard that brings together a bunch of useful stuff in one place.
*   **HackOS:** A web-based OS I’m working on for fun.
*   **Hackintosh:** A project where I made macOS run on non-Apple hardware. Yep, I’m that person. 😎

Right now, I’m diving into TypeScript and trying to level up my coding skills. The best part about coding for me is that if I can imagine it, I can build it (as long as I don’t break everything first). 🤯

When I’m not coding, I’m watching tech videos or making my own YouTube videos about tech stuff. 📱🎥 Oh, and I’m a big Apple fan. If you are too, we’ll probably get along. 🍏

Feel free to hit me up if you want to collaborate or just talk about tech. I’m always down for that! 😄

P.S. The Shrek in my profile pic isn’t me… or is it? 👀
