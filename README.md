# Hi, I'm Divpreet! 👋
Aspiring Developer from India, Living in the UAE

💻 I build games, web apps, and iOS tools using Python, Swift, SwiftUI, and Svelte. Right now, I’m diving into TypeScript to level up my skills.

✨ I study: Python, Swift, SwiftUI, Svelte, TypeScript

## About me:

😄 **Fun fact:** I’m working on a programming language called ScurvyScript (it’s a little high-seas themed).

🔭 **I’m looking to collaborate** on cool projects, ideas, or just chat about tech.

📫 **How to reach me:** Feel free to DM or email!

💬 **Ask me about** web apps, iOS tools, or game development.

## My Projects:

*   **Desky app:** An always-on desk helper for everything you need.
*   **ScurvyScript:** A fun programming language with a pirate twist. 🏴‍☠️
*   **QuickBytes:** A dashboard that brings together all your useful info in one place.
*   **HackOS:** A web-based OS I’m building for fun!
*   **Hackintosh:** Made macOS run on non-Apple hardware (yes, I’m that person). 😎

## My Stack:

*   **Languages:** Python, Swift, SwiftUI, Svelte, TypeScript
*   **Tools:** Xcode, VS Code, Git, Docker
*   **Other:** Working on learning more about web development and TypeScript.

## My Journey:

I’ve been building random projects for fun, learning as I go, and enjoying every bit of the process. Coding has taught me that I can build anything I imagine, as long as I don’t break everything first. 😅

Feel free to check out my repos, and let me know if you want to collaborate or just talk tech!

P.S. The Shrek in my profile pic isn’t me… or is it? 👀
